# Inelastic_Event_Generation

 To build this program simply run make which will produce the executable inelastic1
# Running ./inelastic1 -h will print a help meassage which shows the allowed options
# and what the default setting for each are. 

# It should be noted, the main loop in this code tells pythia to generate a single event 
# per loop and then checks to see if the event produced is a ep -> e'pi+n event. If it is
# then it will store the event in the LUND format in the given output file. If it isn't then
# it just skips along to the next event and doesn't put anything in the output file. What
# this means is that even though the program may be told to generate 50,000 events as an argument
# it will put signifcantly less than 50,000 event in the output file because they aren't all
# ep -> e'pi+n events. The total number of events put in the output file will be printed at
# end of execution.
